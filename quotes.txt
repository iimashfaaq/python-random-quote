Responsive is better than fast
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
Be yourself; everyone else is already taken
Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe
A room without books is like a body without a soul
Be the change that you wish to see in the world
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on
Live life as if it's your last day
